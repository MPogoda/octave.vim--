This file provides syntax highlighting for the GNU Octave programming language.

Features
* Highlights entire Octave grammar (endwhile, endfor, etc.) not just Matlab keywords
* Updated to highlight all core Octave functions as of version 3.4.0
* Highlights user functions from within the .m file being edited
* Use-dependent highlighting of Octave system variables
   When querying system variables, keyword is highlighted as a constant.  For example, var = true, highlights 'true' as a constant.
   When setting variables or otherwise invoking keyword as function, keyword is highlighted as function.  For example, var = true (2,4), highlights 'true' as function.
* Support for multi-line strings with line continuation characters as well as escaped quotes (\" or &#039) within string.
* Support for new multi-line block comments
* Error highlighting for bad number syntax, bad structure variable names, bad block comments, bad line continuations.
* Optional support for highlighting operators (+, -, *, etc.), user variables, or tabs

Errata
* Occasionally user variables, with the same name as a core function, are highlighted when on the LHS of an assignment.
  For example, '[type, info] = xxx' will highlight both keywords type and info.  The predominant use case, 'type = xxx' WILL be correctly treated as a user variable.

Addenda

This script owes some debt to the two existing Octave syntax scripts:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1241
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1591

However, it has been thoroughly rewritten and expanded considerably.
